When clicking the MEAN and AVERAGE buttons, the corresponding function will be run as required in the assignment.

The REFRESH button is used to reload the page and clear up everything.

I have also created a section at the left bottom:

You can enter your goal of mean grade you want to achieve and the system will respond with a alert box telling you what mean grade of the rest of your exams should be to achieve your grade.

Assuming 100% is the full mark. You have a chance of getting the "unattainable" message if your goal is set too high that even if you have 100% for the rest of your grade, you still can't achieve your goal.
